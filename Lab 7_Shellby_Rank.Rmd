It's me, Shellbs. I created this rmd file.

Adrienne on the collab. Going to make some histograms

```{r}

library(tidyverse)

kermit<-read_csv("kermit.csv")
kermit

#Made a histogram
kermit_hist<-ggplot(kermit, aes(x=Score.pre))+
  geom_histogram()+
  facet_wrap(~Gender)

kermit_hist

```


Creator: doing some rank based tests

```{r}

#Is there a significant difference in pre-talk Kermit scores for males and females?

# Unpaired: Mann-Whitney U

mwu_kermit <- kermit %>% 
  wilcox.test(Score.pre ~ Gender, data = .)

mwu_kermit

```
There is no significant difference in pre-talk ranks between males and females.
